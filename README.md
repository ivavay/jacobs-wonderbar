# Blackout Poetry Maker üí≠ ‚úçüèª

Are you ready to get back to writing poetry but need something to work with? Blackout poetry is a reductive writing method that lets you mark out words in black until the remaining words form a poem. Simply copy and paste a block of text to the textbox, click display text, and start marking away! There's an option to save your finished piece as a PNG if you want to share it with your friends!

## How was this made?

I first started out by figuring out how to block out spans of texts. Then, I figured out how to get each word from the textarea to convert to span elements. Finally, I used the HTML2CANVAS library to save the finished piece as a PNG. 

Thanks for Stackoverflow for the help!
